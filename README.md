### About me

### Are you a recruiter ?

If so you probably want to have a look at my [website](https://saveman71.com). From there you can download my resume and why not read a few of my blog posts.

  > Since leaving @LaBelleAssiette, I haven't worked via GitHub much. Thus the contribution graph looks a bit empty 🕸️.

  > As much as I understand some recruiters may be quick to judge the lack of activity, I'm still very active and looking for new opportunities ;)
