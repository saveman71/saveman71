## Hi! Nice to meet you, I'm Antoine 👋

### About me

I'm a French seasoned Full-stack Software Engineer (previously lead at @LaBelleAssiette), currently working as a freelance. I work with companies to build great products with polished UX and a great sense of detail.

Want to chat with me ? Shoot me an email!

### Are you a recruiter ?

If so you probably want to have a look at my [website](https://saveman71.com). From there you can download my resume and why not read a few of my blog posts.

  > Since leaving @LaBelleAssiette, I haven't worked via GitHub much. Thus the contribution graph looks a bit empty 🕸️.

  > As much as I understand some recruiters may be quick to judge the lack of activity, I'm still very active and looking for new opportunities ;)
